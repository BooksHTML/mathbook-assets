FCLA Styles
===========
Styling for Rob Beezer's First Course In Linear Algebra.

Getting Started
---------------
You've just cloned the repo and you're at a loss for what to do... 

Start by installing Compass: http://compass-style.org/install/

Then run the boostrap script from the repo root directory:
    $ ./scripts/bootstrap.sh

SASS / Compass
--------------
This project uses the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) css precompiler and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) CSS Authoring Framework. If you are a designer and you are not familiar with SASS, don't worry, it is absolutely worth learning to use it.

To compile SASS scss files to css:
    $ compass compile [path/to/project]

To watch the scss directory for changes and automatically compile:
    $ compass watch [path/to/project]

The full list of Compass commands can be found [here][http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/command-line/].
