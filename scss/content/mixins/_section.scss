// Note: in Sass the %placeholder is a special selector that has no output 
// unless used in an @extend directive.

// Here I am providing both a placeholder class (denoted by %) and a mixin.
// @extend-ing the placeholder  creates a comma separated list in the CSS.
// This is preferred because it produces less total CSS output
// and the resulting CSS output is easier to edit manually

// However, if you wish to separate two items in the CSS output,
// or it is infeasible to @extend the placholder,
// use the corresponding mixin (with @include) to inject the rules directly
